# QBasic-Array-Problem
This is where I have the solution of challenge given by matt sir to me. The question seems very strange at first. 
But when I look it after in my home, I feel it very simple but very very interesting. I worked with it and enjojed a lot. 
And some how I fixed it but I still don't know it is correct or not.I think it would be more interesting to solve this 
problem with c++. I did it with QBasic taking the logic of calculator that we made last month.It is so interesting, 
I donknow why?
 
I hope you will understand all by looking it how I did it.Thank you very much sir! You always encourage me to learn new things.
My steps will be going on accoading to your feedback bacause you told last time "there is nothing limiting our hardwork".

Obstacles that I have found
===========================
* I tried to do it with sub routines but I could not identify its logic.
* Statement 'exit do' is not working. <I replaced it with 'end'>
